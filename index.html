                        <strong>Course Tasks</strong><br>
                        Each week, we will complete a module (unit of study). For each module, you will be responsible for completing<br> the following tasks described below. This course is different than a traditional online course. I redesigned the blended learning format to place an emphasis on digital literacy skills. This course runs under the pretense that you will<br> be publishing from your own website using your own domain as a writer, reader and lifeguard.<br>
                        <br>
                        This course will use unconventional methods and that is okay. This course does not use the American Red Cross<br> learning system. Instead, we will be using a social network tool called Slack which will act as our learning system.<br>
                        Slack will act as our class stream.<br>
